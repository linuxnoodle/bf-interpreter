	This code runs at pointer offset two and unknown bit width; don't
	assume you have more that eight bits

	======= DEMO CODE =======
	First just print "Hello"

	Notice that I reset the cells despite knowing that they are zero
	this is a test for proper functioning of the ability to skip over
	a loop that's never executed but isn't actually a comment loop

	Secondly there's a NOP movement between the two 'l' characters

	Also there's some commented out code afterwards
