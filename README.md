# bf-interpreter
Basic bf interpreter. Was 3 am, and had the motivation to start working on this, so I made it. (note that this is a piece of garbage, half the time it just stops working, but hey, it works sometimes, and that's what really matters)
## Building
```
git clone https://github.com/linuxnoodle/bf-interpreter
cd bf-interpreter
make
```
